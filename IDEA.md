Hereâ€™s the idea!

This will be a file system accessible from anywhere. It runs on Linux, listening on a port and waiting for read and write operations. The program should be capable of linking stored files together in a chain, ensuring that the data cannot be altered by others. Data should only be modified by the program itself using algorithms that chain the files sequentially.

Ultimately, the program must be able to distribute all files, now chained, across the system or other system partitions. The data should be exportable. These files could be stored by a single system or by millions of systems. The distributed data, akin to blockchain technology, should be compared and verified. The chain formed among systems must remain consistent; if a chain breaks, the data in other programs should become unusable, requiring reformatting and downloading or retaining verified data.

Note!

If a user wishes to create a chain similar to a blockchain, for example, if a user wants to build a chat system with this program (data storage), the core must be run on a server so users can exchange, verify, download, or upload data among themselves. (This might change in the future.)

In conclusion!

No data should be stored by any storage systems such as Clouds or servers.
